Authors: name surname, name surname

This is your lab journal. Use it to protocol what you did (even if it did not work) and to describe how you tried to solve the exercise. In case an experiment did not turn out as expected, describe what you did, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.

This file is in markdown format and rendered nicely in the web. See [this link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for further information about how markdown works.
